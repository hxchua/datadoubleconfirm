25,Go the Distance,Hercules,1997,"I have often dreamed of a far off place Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me Where the crowds would cheer, when they see my face And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be  I'll be there someday, I can go the distance I will find my way if I can be strong I know every mile would be worth my while When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong  Down an unknown road to embrace my fate Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you And a thousand years would be worth the wait It might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through  And I won't look back, I can go the distance And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat It's an uphill slope But I won't loose hope, 'till I go the distance And my journey is complete, oh yeah  But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part For a hero's strength is measured by his heart, oh  Like a shooting star, I will go the distance I will search the world, I will face its harms I don't care how far, I can go the distance 'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms  I will search the world, I will face its harms 'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms"

The streets are lined with Little creatures laughing Everybody seems so happy Have I possibly gone daffy? What is this? What's this?  There's children throwing snowballs Instead of throwing heads They're busy building toys And absolutely no one's dead  There's frost on every window Oh, I can't believe my eyes And in my bones I feel the warmth That's coming from inside  Oh, look, what's this? They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss Why that looks so unique? Inspired They're gathering around to hear a story Roasting chestnuts on a fire What's this?  What's this? In here they've got a little tree, how queer And who would ever think And why?  They're covering it with tiny little things They've got electric lights on strings And there's a smile on everyone So, now, correct me if I'm wrong  This looks like fun This looks like fun Oh, could it be I got my wish? What's this?  Oh my, what now? The children are asleep But look, there's nothing underneath No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them Or ensnare them, only little cozy things Secure inside their dreamland  What's this? The monsters are all missing And the nightmares can't be found And in their place there seems to be Good feeling all around  Instead of screams, I swear I can hear music in the air The smell of cakes and pies Are absolutely everywhere  The sights, the sounds They're everywhereand all around I've never felt so good before This empty place inside of me is filling up I simply cannot get enough  I want it, oh, I want it Oh, I want it for my own I've got to know, I've got to know What is this place that I have found? What is this?  Christmas town? Hmm"
